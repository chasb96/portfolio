    <hr />

    <p>
        A cloud storage server made specifically for personal use.

        <br /><br />

        Originally designed at request from a friend, but later expanded to hit personal needs.
        This project is meant to allow storage of files at a remote location, rather than
        needing an outside service to do so. It allows creating, updating, and deleting files
        within a folder structure similar to what one would find on a personal computer. Recently,
        to accomodate personal goals, the project has been expanded to allow public file sharing
        and video streaming.

        <br /><br />

        The project is currently deployed with Digital Ocean, on an Ubuntu 18.04 machine.
        Using <a href="https://nginx.org">Nginx</a> as a webserver, and
        <a href="https://rocket.rs">Rocket</a> to handle traffic. It uses a PostgreSQL Database,
        hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS) RDS. The project is written in
        <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.

    </div>

    <hr />

    <p>
        A tool made to perform configured tasks automatically.

        <br /><br />

        Originally intended as a learning experience, this project is now a tool that provides
        simple task automation. The project can be made to perform scripts triggered by a timer,
        intervals, or disk changes. This project was used to build an integration service,
        listed below.

    <p>
        This project creates a connection between numerous devices, allowing them to communicate
        directly without creating a direct connection between them. It is targeted towards
        devices within a small range of each other, such as within a house or apartment.

        <br /><br />

        This project, as of now, can open a Websocket Server with both Basic and Token
        authentication. It can track every device connected and log every message sent. It
        also has a portal accessable through the browser, allowing the user to see all
        current activity, and create new access tokens for new devices.

        <br /><br />

        It is written in Rust with PostgreSQL,
        using WS-RS as the Websocket interface, Rocket for the web interface,
        Diesel as the ORM, and Tera for the templating engine. It utilizes an event-handling
        system similar to that of the automation tool, to handle and direct traffic and
        perform directed behavior upon the events of triggering messages.
